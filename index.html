                    Hello everyone my name is Christopher, no one really calls me that unless your my mom screaming my
                    name
                    because I forgot to do the dishes or defrost the chicken.If you struggle to recognize who I am,
                    just look
                    to the corner of the classroom.....Yeah that guy! There really isn't much to me, I spend my time in
                    the gym
                    or in the kitchen trying to come up new ways to make a bowl of spinach sound remotely attractive. I
                    love to
                    dance, blast music (all types except for country,sorry), hit the lanes and watch movies. I have
                    moved
                    around quite a bit, went from only visiting for a couple of week to almost being here for almost a
                    year.
                    Hopefully you'll get to know me a lot more these next couple of months while we all suffer together
                    and
                    achieve whatever goal we came here with
                </div>
